Welcome to the Frost gem project
===========================

The charter of the Ruby Frost gem project is to provide Red Hat Consultants 
with common set of tools and utilities to help with Cloudform implementations.

We will add more in the near future.  Currently this gem is under construction
but it won't be long before we get this populated!

In the meantime please visit manageiq.org to get the latest open source
Cloudforms appliance for you environment!

Best,
Lester
